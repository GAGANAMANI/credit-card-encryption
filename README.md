# Credit Card Encryption & Tokenization System

This project demonstrates secure handling of credit card Primary Account Numbers (PAN) using encryption, tokenization, and masking techniques.

## Features
- AES-based encryption of credit card numbers
- Token generation for secure reference
- PAN masking for safe display
- Secure storage without saving raw PAN
- Controlled decryption for authorized access

## Technologies Used
- Python
- cryptography library

## Purpose
This project was developed for educational purposes as part of a Cyber Security internship to demonstrate industry-relevant data protection techniques.

## Security Note
Only dummy credit card numbers are used. This project is not intended for real-world payment processing.

## Disclaimer
This implementation is for academic and learning purposes only.
